# HoughTransform_Line_Detection
The Hough transform for line detection is a computer vision technique that identifies straight lines in an image by transforming image points into a parameter space where collinear points (points that lie on the same line) converge at a single point, allowing for easy detection of lines even if they are partially obscured or noisy, by "voting"
